## Introduction

This project is a small collection of convenience and utility classes (mostly used by other FreeLibrary projects). It includes utilities related to I/O, resource bundles, string manipulation, and class loaders. It used to contain a set of Maven plugins, but those have been moved to a new project, [freelib-maven-plugins](https://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-maven-plugins).

## Building the Project

To build freelib-utils, you will need JDK 17 or higher and Maven 3.2.2 or higher. Once you have those installed, you can check the project out from GitHub and build it with the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/ksclarke/freelib-utils.git
    cd freelib-utils
    mvn install

If you want to use a pre-built version, please consult the project's [home page](http://projects.freelibrary.info/freelib-utils) to learn more.
